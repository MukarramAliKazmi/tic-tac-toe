## Credits

Built entirely by me—no AI code‑generation tools were used.
I consulted Stack Overflow and W3Schools documentation for specific JavaScript and CSS questions. The design is inspired by Google's built-in Tic Tac Toe game.

## Assignment

This project was completed for [The Odin Project – Tic Tac Toe Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe).
